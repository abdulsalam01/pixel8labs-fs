# GitHub OAuth Frontend

Welcome to the GitHub OAuth Frontend of our application. This frontend is responsible for providing a user-friendly interface for GitHub OAuth authentication, displaying user data, and interacting with the GitHub OAuth Backend. This README provides a comprehensive overview of the frontend structure, components, and setup instructions.

## Technology Stack

### Next.js 13
The frontend is built using Next.js 13, a powerful and versatile framework for building web applications. Next.js offers server-side rendering, a great developer experience, and excellent performance.

### Tailwind CSS
We utilize Tailwind CSS for styling the frontend. Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that simplifies the styling process and allows for rapid development.

### React Context
We leverage React Context for state management within our frontend. This provides a simple and efficient way to share state and data throughout the application.

### Custom Hooks
Custom hooks have been implemented for efficient data fetching and state management. These hooks encapsulate common functionalities and enhance code reusability.

### No External REST API Client
To interact with the backend, we use built-in libraries and the Next.js API. This eliminates the need for additional external REST API client libraries, reducing the complexity of the frontend.

## Installation and Setup

To set up and run the frontend, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install Node.js and npm on your system if not already installed.
3. Navigate to the "frontend" directory.
4. Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

5. Start the frontend server with the following command:

   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

This will start the frontend server, and you can access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Project Structure

Our frontend follows a well-organized structure that makes it easy to navigate and understand. Here are some key aspects of the project structure:

- **Atomic Pattern**: We follow the atomic design pattern, which categorizes components into atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages. This ensures a structured and maintainable codebase.

- **Custom Hooks**: Custom hooks are used to encapsulate reusable logic and facilitate data fetching, state management, and other common operations.

- **React Context**: We use React Context for global state management, making it easy to share data across components without prop drilling.

- **Tailwind CSS**: Styling is handled with Tailwind CSS, which simplifies the process of applying styles to elements.

## GitHub API Integration

Our frontend communicates with the GitHub OAuth Backend to retrieve user data and repository information. We use the API endpoints provided by the backend for data retrieval.

## Running the Application

1. Start the backend as instructed in the GitHub OAuth Backend README.
2. Navigate to the "frontend" directory.
3. Run the frontend server with the following command:

   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

This README provides a comprehensive understanding of the GitHub OAuth Frontend, its components, and its setup. For detailed code explanations and specific code implementations, please refer to the source code and comments within the frontend repository files.

Feel free to explore the code and make any necessary adjustments or enhancements to tailor it to your specific use case.
